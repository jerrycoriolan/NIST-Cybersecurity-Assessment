# NIST-Cybersecurity-Assessment
I will design a comprehensive cybersecurity program for Goodcorp that:

-	Highlights the current deficiencies in Goodcorp’s cybersecurity controls. 
-	Create a three-year roadmap for Goodcorp to improve its cybersecurity posture.
-	Using the NIST CSF cybersecurity program spreadsheet
-	I won’t be using the scoring system for this assessment as the scoring system tends to be very subjective, can vary depending on the auditor, and can be misleading.

Identify:
1.	Physical devices and systems within the organization are inventoried, so this control is passable. However, the CMDB needs periodic reviews, so I left a comment for the cybersecurity team. 

2.	Software platforms and applications within the organization are not inventoried. The information provided by Goodcorp states that their CMDB currently only captures laptop serial numbers. They also rely entirely on a SaaS solution, which tells me there are no physical servers, and the only physical asset is probably just the laptops. The CMDB needs to capture all physical, software, and even intellectual property, and for that reason, Goodcorp has failed to this control. 

3.	 The network team has up-to-date network diagrams; this is a pass. 

4.	External information systems, such as third parties and SaaS solutions, should be cataloged in the CMDB; this is a failure.

5.	Assets have yet to be classified based on sensitivity and criticality; this is a fail.

6.	The organization needs clear documentation outlining its role within its own supply chain regarding cybersecurity and third-party suppliers.

7.	Critical infrastructure deals with something that affects the nation. For example, the decrease in public transportation would affect many people. Goodcorp is not a critical infrastructure; this is marked as N/A. 

8.	Goodcorp does have a clear business strategy and mission statement; this is a pass.

9.	Assets and supplies should be classified based on criticality and sensitivity. The organization should have a clear list of its key critical assets; this is a fail. 

10.	Goodcorp has an IT team that runs a cloud instance. Cloud instances usually have some backup or resiliency procedure, so this is a pass.
